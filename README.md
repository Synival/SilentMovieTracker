# Silent Movie Tracker

Browser app for tracking silent movies. This comes with one cue sheet for
"Henry's Busted Romance" (1922) from Fables Pictures, Inc. Although the cue
sheets support local files (simply write the relative path), an online MP4
link is provided to avoid uploading ~750mb to GitHub.

[Try it out on GitHub pages!\*](https://synival.github.io/SilentMovieTracker/)  
\* _Don't forget to enable pop-ups for the projector window._
